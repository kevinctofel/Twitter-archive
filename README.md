# Twitter-archive
An archive of my Tweets is the plan. I'll keep those in GitHub which will then populate them to my personal blog.

I have the Twitter timeline embed code just to see what the output looks like

Next step is to use their API to get my timeline, likely in JSON, and present it on my blog.
